##

**1. Converter to JSON:**

> Simple python script that converts a CSV file to a JSON file.
> The 'csv' library provides the 'DictReader' class which reads the CSV file and returns a dictionary for each row,
> library named 'json' provides the 'dump' function which writes the dictionary to the JSON file. The 'dump' function takes the dictionary and the file handler as arguments.
> 'Attrgetter' function from 'operator' library is used to get the value of a key in the dictionary.

## 

**2. Crypto Currency Exchange:**
  
> Program allows to check the current price of crypto currencies and buy them using the CoinGecko API,
> uses ses the 'requests' library to send requests to the CoinGecko API and the 'time' library to measure the time of code execution.

## 

**3. Financial data of listed Companies from the Server:**

> Program is a simple stock information program that uses the Yahoo Finance API to get the stock data of a company,
> uses the 'yfinance' library to get the stock data of a company by entering the stock ticker in the entry widget,
> displays the stock data in the text box widget, also displays the stock data history for the last month with daily intervals in the text box widget.

## 

**4. Pandas_NumPy:**
  
> Contains one file made in Jupyter Notebook, basicaly a notebook with some useful code.

## 

**5. Testing:**
  
> Contains all test files made with PyTest, Robot Framework, Selenium and Unitest.
> Example above shows partialy one of the files from Testing/RobotFramework/test_demo_files directory.

## 

**6. Exchange Rates:**
  
> Program is used to get the latest exchange rates from the exchange_rates_api website, provides the latest exchange rates for free:
>   * using the 'latest' endpoint, for 'USD', 'AUD', 'CAD', 'PLN', and 'MXN'
>   * using the 'symbols' parameter,
>   * using for a specific base currency using the 'base' parameter.
